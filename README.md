## 📖 Overview
**FundMe** is a decentralized crowdfunding smart contract built with **Solidity** and the **Foundry** framework.  
It allows users to fund a project with ETH while enforcing a minimum USD value using **Chainlink Price Feeds**.  
Only the contract owner can withdraw the funds.

This project demonstrates secure smart contract development, testing, deployment, and CI integration.
